### What is TBOI-EEID?
TBOI-EEID is shorten of The Binding Of Isaac External External Item Description

### Why has this project has started?
The goal for this project is to make a third-party program (specifically External Item Description) that runs without any mod implimentation for multiplayer version of TBOI.
We started this project as my friend (a.k.a the main developer) willing to have a EID running while playing multiplayer. Since multiplayer does not allow any mod features, 
we thought of creating our own EID.

### What does the program do?
As written above, the program will have most of the functions from External Item Description but as a third-party as program as multiplayer does not support any mods.

### Progress Check?
We are using pyautogui and cv2 to detect any items in the screen and convert that information in to a specificed code and show the item description. 
We are currently planning to have only the basic items for now, adding more information in the future.
